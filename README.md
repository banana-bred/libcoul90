# LIBCOUL90

Calculate real-valued Coulomb and Bessel functions for real-valued arguments.
The original `COUL90()`, available at the
[Fresco](https://www.fresco.org.uk/programs/barnett/index.htm) website, has been repackaged here as an
[fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) package.
See the original author's article [[1]](#1) for more detail.
This is largely not my work.
No intentional changes to the algorithm have been made.
Test suite not yet implemented, but the tester program from the
[Fresco](https://www.fresco.org.uk/programs/barnett/index.htm) website is available.

## Building with [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)
In the package directory, just run

    $ fpm build --profile release

The archive file `libcoul90.a` and `.mod` files will be placed in the generated `build` subdirectory.
These files are necessary to compile another program that uses this library.

## Using this version of `COUL90()`

To use this project within your [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:

    [dependencies]
    libcoul90 = { git="https://github.com/banana-bred/libcoul90" }

or

    [dependencies]
    libcoul90 = {'namespace'='COULXX'}

The module `libcoul90` contains the following public procedures :

- `coulf(lambda,eta,x)` : return the regular Coulomb function $F_\lambda(\eta,x)$
- `coulg(lambda,eta,x)` : return the irregular Coulomb function $G_\lambda(\eta,x)$
- `sphbessj(lambda,x)` : return the spherical Bessel function of the first kind $j_\lambda(x)$
- `sphbessy(lambda,x)` : return the spherical Bessel function of the second kind $y_\lambda(x)$
- `cylbessj(lambda,x)` : return the (cylindrical) Bessel function of the first kind $J_\lambda(x)$
- `cylbessy(lambda,x)` : return the (cylindrical) Bessel function of the second kind $Y_\lambda(x)$
- `coul90_wrapper(xlmin, nl, eta, x, f, fp, g, gp, kfn)` : a wrapper used to call `COUL90()`, used by the above-mentioned procedures
- `COUL90(X,ETA_IN,XLMIN,LRANGE,FC,GC,FCP,GCP,KFN,IFAIL)` : the original code described in [[1]](#1), with some minor modernizations.
- `ricbes(x, lmax, psi, chi, psid, chid, ifail)` : a subroutine that returns the Riccati-Bessel functions $zj_\lambda(z)$ and $zy_\lambda(z)$, and their derivatives in the arrays
`psi`, `chi`, `psid`, and `chid` for orders $0$ -- $\lambda_\text{max}$
- `sbesjy(x, lmax, j, y, jp, yp, ifail)` : a subroutine that returns the spherical Bessel functions functions $j_\lambda(z)$ and $y_\lambda(z)$, and their derivatives in the arrays
`psi`, `chi`, `psid`, and `chid` for orders $0$ -- $\lambda_\text{max}$

Above, `LMAX` is the same as $\lambda_\text{max}$ and `nl` is the number of $\lambda$ values.
The variables `x` and `eta` are `real(real64)`, while the variable `lambda` can be an `integer` or `real(real64)`.
The kind `real64` (64 bits / 8 bytes) is defined in the intrinsic module `iso_fortran_env`.
All public procedures other than `COUL90()` are superfluous â€” they're provided for convenience or as a simple example of calling `COUL90()`.

The following example program

    program test

      use libcoul90, only: coulf
      use iso_fortran_env, only: rp => real64, stdout => output_unit

      integer :: l = 0
      real(rp) :: eta = -0.5_rp
      real(rp) :: x = 20.0_rp

      write(stdout, '("F_", I0, "(", F0.2, ",", F0.2, ") = ", e0.15)') l, eta, x, coulf(l, eta, x)

    end program test

should print the following:

    F_0(-.50,20.00) = -0.102372301807428

## Testing with [fpm](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm)

The tester program can be run with the following command

    $ fpm test

This will read the file `test/COULTEST.in` and produce a file `test/COULTEST.out`, whose output can be compared to the reference file `test/COULTEST.REF`.
